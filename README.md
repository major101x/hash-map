# HashMap
This is a HashMap project from TheOdinProject where I had to write a hashMap and various methods to manage the nodes in it.

## Lessons Learned
I learned about hash maps, buckets and how to manage collisions in hash maps using a growth function to double the capacity of the array and re-hash its keys when the array has exceeded it's load factor.
